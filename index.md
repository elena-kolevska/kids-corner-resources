# Kids' corners everywhere

Kids' corners should be the norm everywhere: banks, hospitals, restaurants, and especially professional events and conferences. Parents shouldn't be missing on investing in their career just because they have kids to take care of. There are many single parents who don't have a co-parent or a close family nearby.  
Let's make some noise and make this happen! We are a community and we should take care of each other. Let’s send some love to all the hardworking, loving parents out there and help make their lives easier, at least a little bit :) Tweet with the hashtag #kidscornerseverywhere to your favourite conference, your local event, offer to help…  Heck, maybe even volunteer to be Elsa, IronMen or Santa for an hour. Why not? And who knows, you might end up having a lot more fun than on the event ;)


Let's put together our knowledge and compile a great list of resources for conferences organisers to use to set up kids' corners on their events.

To support the movement please add to this list or post with the hastag `#kidscornerseverywhere`
