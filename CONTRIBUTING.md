# Contributing Guide

1. The file structure is as follows: The top level `README.md` file serves as an index for all countries.
2. Every country has its own folder with its own `README.md` file as an index of all towns and cities in that country. Every town/city should have its own file.
3. Country-specific tips/laws/regulations should be added in the `README.md` file of the country folder.
4. Make sure you check if a resource already exists before adding it! This goes for countries and cities too.
5. If you're adding a new country or a city please make sure you add it to the appropriate indexes (check points 1 and 2 ) 
6. Always add your items to the end of a list.
